Problem: 
The distance test on user1 devices responds the first time they are linked, and then never again. This is because the hardware of the distance sensor itself is not working. After testing with another device, We still can't upload the code to the IO.

Result: 
User1 device could not react and could not upload data to the IO. user2 could react and upload data in the IO normally. Both devices did not successfully communicate in the IO.
